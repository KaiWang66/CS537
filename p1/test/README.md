This is the testing framework of project1.

To use this framework:

First, go to your handin directory
cd ~cs537-1/handin/login/, where login is your cs login name.

And put your codes there. The filenames should be my-look.c, across.c and my-diff.c

Then, run the command:
~cs537-1/tests/p1/run-tests.sh

For more information on how to use this script, run ~cs537-1/tests/p1/run-tests.sh -h.

There are 20 public test cases released. After running the command, you can see details of the test cases in ./initial-utilities/name_of_the_utility/tests/. If any error occurs, follow the instructions printed to find out what is wrong with your output.

Please do try to improve your code even if you pass all public test cases. There will be 4 hidden test cases for each utility that will be used in the final grading. Passing all public cases does not guarantee a full mark for this assignment.
